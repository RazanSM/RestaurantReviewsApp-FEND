## Description

This project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. The starter code was given by Udacity. I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also a service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Run the Application

In order to run the application you have to:

* Download as .zip file or clone this project:

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

*For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
